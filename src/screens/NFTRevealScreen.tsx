// NFTRevealScreen — the collectibles reveal, the FIRST major beat (the
// treasure chest precedes it and provides the context).
//
// The shelf fills from the live attestation stream. There is no known total
// upfront anymore, so the reveal doesn't wait for a fixed count — it lets
// the user collect whatever arrives and fires the finale once the user has
// stored everything AND the stream has "settled" (`streamSettled`, computed
// in App: outcome resolved / stream went quiet / all 10 in / foreground cap).
// On Continue, App routes to the membership verdict if the outcome resolved,
// otherwise to the Prizes-chat handoff.

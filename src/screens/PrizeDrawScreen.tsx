// PrizeDrawScreen — orchestrates the three sub-stages of the prize-draw
// ceremony:
//
//   sealed  → user sees their ticket, taps REVEAL
//   reveal  → perspective lane scene runs the draw cinematic
//   result  → hero ticket + headline (prize / distance) + countdown + CTA
//
// The screen is one node in App.tsx's stage machine (screen === 'prize_draw').
// Internally it has its own three-phase state and renders the matching
// sub-stage component.
//
// Reduced-motion path: skips 'reveal' entirely; jumps sealed → result so
// the user gets the outcome without the multi-second cinematic.
//
// Bridge events:
//   flow.prize_draw_started  → fires on sealed → reveal transition
//   flow.prize_draw_complete → fires when user taps the result-stage CTA
//                              (carried by onContinue → App.advance)

  // ── Ticket-distance simulation shim ───────────────────────────────
  // The chain doesn't yet expose a real ticket-distance value, so
  // `draw.ticketDistance` from the bridge is meaningless for now. We
  // override it here with a deterministic value derived from the user's
  // ticket hash. All downstream consumers (outcomeFor, LaneScene,
  // ResultHero) keep reading `draw.ticketDistance` as if it were real;
  // they don't need to know about the shim.
  //
  // To DELETE the shim once the chain supports real ticket-distance:
  //   1. Remove the `useMemo` block below.
  //   2. Pass the original `draw` to all three sub-stages instead of
  //      `effectiveDraw`.
  //   3. Delete the import of `simulateTicketDistance` (above).
  //   4. Optionally delete `src/draw/ticketDistance.ts`.
  //
  // The simulation is deterministic per `userTicket`, so refreshing or
  // replaying gives a stable result. Dev-panel mocks that set explicit
  // `ticketDistance` values are intentionally overridden — the
  // simulation is the single source of truth until the chain catches up.
